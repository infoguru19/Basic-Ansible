# Ansible

**Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for:**
 * Configuration management (setting up and maintaining systems)
 * Application deployment
 * Task automation
 * IT orchestration (coordinating multiple systems and services)

## Key Features:
* **Agentless:** You don’t need to install any software on the target systems. It uses SSH to communicate.
* **Simple YAML** syntax: Uses human-readable files called playbooks written in YAML.
* **Idempotent:** Running a playbook multiple times doesn’t change the result unless something needs to be updated.
* **Push-based:** You run commands from a control node, and it pushes instructions to target machines.
